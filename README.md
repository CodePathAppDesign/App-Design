### StressAway
## Planner App 
* **Category:** Tools
* **Description:** a special planner that asks the user to enter a task that they need to complete and the approximate time it will take to complete it. The planner will then give you a suggestion on what to do first, and will remind you to take a break in between tasks. Features listed below illustrate the function of our app in more detail.
* **Mobile:** instant calculation of what work requires what time and logging of the behavior of the user. If a certain task takes some time for the user the app will update that time as the behavior of the user
* **Market:** People who have a lot to do and sometimes feel stressful. Help people manage their time wisely and do work effciently
* **Habit:** Users are using this constantly to organize their taks and see what the plan for their day is. It is a daily usage or better yet an app that one would use 
* **Scope:** V1 would allow users to enter in tasks and how long it takes to complete each task and will remind users to take breaks in between each. V2 would organize tasks so that users can be most efficient based on the level of difficulty of each task (mixing easy and hard tasks). V3 would have the app suggest relaxing songs and tips on how to destress.
* **Story:** Creates a good experience for the user to manage stress and have all the tasks in one app. It logs the behavior of the user
* **Features:**
1. Calender in app that syncs to pre-existing platforms (outlook, gcal, apple)
2. Suggests music or playlists based on the task being performed 
3. Recommends how to break down your tasks based on user behaviour.
4. Reminds user to take study breaks and suggests tips on how to manage stress and relax
